# Welcome to my Webpage

Hi, I'm a graduate of TU Darmstadt(B.Sc.) and currently looking for job opportunities. I try to continuously teach myself new technologies and languages. At the moment I'm getting to know Golang and Python's Django.   
Most of my experience so far has been on the backend side of things which is why I'm currently teaching myself to use Django and the necessary bits of HTML, JS and CSS (mainly following [Corey Schafer's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmljXZIypDc&list=PL-osiE80TeTtoQCKZ03TU5fNfx2UY6U4p)).
Golang is a language I started looking into because of a friend's recommendation. It seems pretty low level when transitioning from using mostly Python. I'm starting to see advantages particularly when comparing Golang to C++ or Java though.

## My CV:

Programming languages: Python, Scala, Golang(, C++, Java)   

# Practical experiences:
- University project: Event correlation system/library based on [CARTESIUS](http://www.st.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/artifacts/corrl/cartesius_preprint.pdf) using Scala and [Scala Effekt](https://github.com/b-studios/scala-effekt)

- Student Assistant - TU Darmstadt Mechanical Engineering:
  1. Automation for a CAD simulation: executing close to 1000 iterations of parameter value changes, running the simulation and processing the simulation result using Java and the Siemens NX API
  2. Configuration of a LAMP server backend including Python and Bash scripts for automatically generating PHP/HTML webpages for product information in the MySQL database (unpublished due to employer priorities)
- Thesis implementation: [Source DPOR](http://user.it.uu.se/~parosh/publications/papers/popl2014.pdf) algorithm, 7 ordering heuristics from previous research, 5 benchmark programs specifically designed for the thesis, 6 benchmark programs from previous research, in total 504 combinations of heuristics and program variations written in C++, Bison, flex, Boost

- Bachelor project: Task-generator(DFA minimization) for a web-based teaching app using Java, XML

- SK Hynix: Order processing (2 months full-time in the transitional phase from school graduation to university)

# University:
- Graduated TU Darmstadt in March 2019 (Thesis title: Effects of Ordering Heuristics on the Source DPOR Algorithm)   
Still waiting for 2 marks to be entered by profs/student office and Bachelor certificate to be printed.

# School:
- Abitur at Gymnasium am Kurf√ºrstlichen Schloss Mainz

# Hobbies (aside from coding):
- Cooking (mostly italian and a little bit of korean)
- Chess (mostly on the puzzle side of things)
